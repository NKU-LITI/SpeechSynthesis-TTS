p239-wav/p239_001.wav|Please call Stella.
p239-wav/p239_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p239-wav/p239_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p239-wav/p239_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p239-wav/p239_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p239-wav/p239_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p239-wav/p239_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p239-wav/p239_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p239-wav/p239_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p239-wav/p239_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p239-wav/p239_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p239-wav/p239_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p239-wav/p239_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p239-wav/p239_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p239-wav/p239_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p239-wav/p239_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p239-wav/p239_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p239-wav/p239_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p239-wav/p239_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p239-wav/p239_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p239-wav/p239_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p239-wav/p239_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p239-wav/p239_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p239-wav/p239_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p239-wav/p239_025.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p239-wav/p239_026.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p239-wav/p239_027.wav|And so was a photograph.
p239-wav/p239_028.wav|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
p239-wav/p239_029.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p239-wav/p239_030.wav|It is about control of our economy.
p239-wav/p239_031.wav|There was a rush of water.
p239-wav/p239_032.wav|That's all I was trying to do today.
p239-wav/p239_033.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p239-wav/p239_034.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p239-wav/p239_035.wav|I might well have done so already.
p239-wav/p239_036.wav|That can cost him a fortune.
p239-wav/p239_037.wav|He works at the airport.
p239-wav/p239_038.wav|How do you take them away?
p239-wav/p239_039.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p239-wav/p239_040.wav|After the match, do you?
p239-wav/p239_041.wav|Has the conflict started?
p239-wav/p239_042.wav|Have I really come to this?
p239-wav/p239_043.wav|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
p239-wav/p239_044.wav|It carried a double message.
p239-wav/p239_045.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p239-wav/p239_046.wav|But not a penny has been paid.
p239-wav/p239_047.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p239-wav/p239_048.wav|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p239-wav/p239_049.wav|We must learn to finish.
p239-wav/p239_050.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p239-wav/p239_051.wav|New York is my home.
p239-wav/p239_052.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p239-wav/p239_053.wav|I remember that day well.
p239-wav/p239_054.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p239-wav/p239_055.wav|He is too weak to move.
p239-wav/p239_056.wav|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239-wav/p239_057.wav|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239-wav/p239_058.wav|Among them are many criminals.
p239-wav/p239_059.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.
p239-wav/p239_060.wav|And they removed a Borderer.
p239-wav/p239_061.wav|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239-wav/p239_062.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.
p239-wav/p239_063.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239-wav/p239_064.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p239-wav/p239_065.wav|They desperately want some stability.
p239-wav/p239_066.wav|Everything is possible in football.
p239-wav/p239_067.wav|Everyone could see the joke.
p239-wav/p239_068.wav|I'm pleased with the horse.
p239-wav/p239_069.wav|He will need that machine.
p239-wav/p239_070.wav|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
p239-wav/p239_071.wav|Then they scored two goals to win.
p239-wav/p239_072.wav|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p239-wav/p239_073.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239-wav/p239_074.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p239-wav/p239_075.wav|Let's not be too despondent.
p239-wav/p239_076.wav|The Government does not go far enough.
p239-wav/p239_077.wav|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p239-wav/p239_078.wav|I haven't got there yet.
p239-wav/p239_079.wav|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239-wav/p239_080.wav|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p239-wav/p239_081.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p239-wav/p239_082.wav|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
p239-wav/p239_084.wav|And it had two seats.
p239-wav/p239_085.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p239-wav/p239_086.wav|Or so the theory goes.
p239-wav/p239_087.wav|He has really done well.
p239-wav/p239_088.wav|So what happens next?
p239-wav/p239_089.wav|Had this been common practice?
p239-wav/p239_090.wav|What do they want us to do?
p239-wav/p239_091.wav|Is it worth it?
p239-wav/p239_092.wav|Does it matter?
p239-wav/p239_093.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239-wav/p239_094.wav|But I had never been in a theatre.
p239-wav/p239_095.wav|It was fun, but not a living.
p239-wav/p239_096.wav|Kenny Miller might come through.
p239-wav/p239_097.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p239-wav/p239_098.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239-wav/p239_099.wav|We will pay their bills.
p239-wav/p239_100.wav|Sales are falling after years of growth.
p239-wav/p239_101.wav|It was exactly four months away.
p239-wav/p239_102.wav|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239-wav/p239_103.wav|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239-wav/p239_104.wav|I am so proud of him.
p239-wav/p239_105.wav|This time, it might be for real.
p239-wav/p239_106.wav|He will be kept informed.
p239-wav/p239_107.wav|There could be a way back.
p239-wav/p239_108.wav|He was a lovely man.
p239-wav/p239_109.wav|People will have to be patient.
p239-wav/p239_110.wav|I can't remember a lot of it.
p239-wav/p239_111.wav|Instead, another depression came in.
p239-wav/p239_112.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p239-wav/p239_113.wav|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p239-wav/p239_114.wav|It is sometimes like that.
p239-wav/p239_115.wav|The partners are looking for answers.
p239-wav/p239_116.wav|I've had it for the exams.
p239-wav/p239_117.wav|Those people must be accountable.
p239-wav/p239_118.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p239-wav/p239_119.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.
p239-wav/p239_120.wav|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p239-wav/p239_121.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.
p239-wav/p239_122.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p239-wav/p239_123.wav|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p239-wav/p239_124.wav|He was just a journalist.
p239-wav/p239_125.wav|They lived for their children.
p239-wav/p239_126.wav|Their season has been consigned to history.
p239-wav/p239_127.wav|Diversions were put in place.
p239-wav/p239_128.wav|How independent is that?
p239-wav/p239_129.wav|What form did that take?
p239-wav/p239_130.wav|Are they free?
p239-wav/p239_131.wav|What are they for?
p239-wav/p239_132.wav|Is there a waiting list?
p239-wav/p239_133.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p239-wav/p239_134.wav|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
p239-wav/p239_135.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p239-wav/p239_136.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p239-wav/p239_137.wav|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p239-wav/p239_138.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p239-wav/p239_139.wav|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239-wav/p239_140.wav|So it was at Easter Road.
p239-wav/p239_141.wav|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
p239-wav/p239_142.wav|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p239-wav/p239_143.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p239-wav/p239_144.wav|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p239-wav/p239_145.wav|We just have to adapt.
p239-wav/p239_146.wav|He was forced to quit.
p239-wav/p239_147.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p239-wav/p239_148.wav|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p239-wav/p239_149.wav|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p239-wav/p239_150.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239-wav/p239_151.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.
p239-wav/p239_152.wav|Since then, things have improved.
p239-wav/p239_153.wav|That's what happened against Ayr.
p239-wav/p239_154.wav|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p239-wav/p239_155.wav|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p239-wav/p239_156.wav|It is a good lifestyle.
p239-wav/p239_157.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.
p239-wav/p239_158.wav|Our relationship has been very good.
p239-wav/p239_159.wav|It was the climax of the thing.
p239-wav/p239_160.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.
p239-wav/p239_161.wav|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p239-wav/p239_162.wav|I think the referee was good.
p239-wav/p239_163.wav|I understand the medical concerns.
p239-wav/p239_164.wav|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p239-wav/p239_165.wav|This was a unique election.
p239-wav/p239_166.wav|They exist in name alone.
p239-wav/p239_167.wav|We have reacted well to each other.
p239-wav/p239_168.wav|I can see it now.
p239-wav/p239_169.wav|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p239-wav/p239_170.wav|There's still plenty time left.
p239-wav/p239_171.wav|Those three weeks are totally lost.
p239-wav/p239_172.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p239-wav/p239_173.wav|She is in good spirits.
p239-wav/p239_174.wav|As if that is an achievement.
p239-wav/p239_175.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.
p239-wav/p239_176.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p239-wav/p239_177.wav|There was a fossil on screen.
p239-wav/p239_178.wav|Is it in the right place?
p239-wav/p239_179.wav|Did he trip?
p239-wav/p239_180.wav|Does that put pressure on us?
p239-wav/p239_181.wav|Did it work?
p239-wav/p239_182.wav|Do you think we are a top nation?
p239-wav/p239_183.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p239-wav/p239_184.wav|Structural changes were also required.
p239-wav/p239_185.wav|His job was not advertised.
p239-wav/p239_186.wav|That was just one night.
p239-wav/p239_187.wav|This is a frightening development.
p239-wav/p239_188.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p239-wav/p239_189.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p239-wav/p239_190.wav|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p239-wav/p239_191.wav|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p239-wav/p239_192.wav|My father died in childbirth.
p239-wav/p239_193.wav|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p239-wav/p239_194.wav|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239-wav/p239_195.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p239-wav/p239_196.wav|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239-wav/p239_197.wav|You've got to be vigilant.
p239-wav/p239_198.wav|He said the director had been completely friendly.
p239-wav/p239_199.wav|Tiger is not the norm.
p239-wav/p239_200.wav|It's been a humbling year.
p239-wav/p239_201.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p239-wav/p239_202.wav|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p239-wav/p239_203.wav|It is all to do with the coaching.
p239-wav/p239_204.wav|There was a fine line to tread.
p239-wav/p239_205.wav|The refund is fully justified.
p239-wav/p239_206.wav|My wife and family are the support system.
p239-wav/p239_207.wav|We are now working with full-time on future product.
p239-wav/p239_208.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p239-wav/p239_209.wav|He is a very talented player.
p239-wav/p239_210.wav|Bottling is now the core business.
p239-wav/p239_211.wav|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239-wav/p239_212.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p239-wav/p239_213.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p239-wav/p239_214.wav|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p239-wav/p239_215.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.
p239-wav/p239_216.wav|We had to add value.
p239-wav/p239_217.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p239-wav/p239_218.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p239-wav/p239_219.wav|So I got a blood test.
p239-wav/p239_220.wav|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239-wav/p239_221.wav|I was caught out a little bit.
p239-wav/p239_222.wav|There's always the next century.
p239-wav/p239_223.wav|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p239-wav/p239_224.wav|But it's an enjoyable job.
p239-wav/p239_225.wav|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p239-wav/p239_226.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p239-wav/p239_227.wav|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p239-wav/p239_228.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p239-wav/p239_229.wav|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p239-wav/p239_230.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p239-wav/p239_231.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p239-wav/p239_232.wav|It would seem a natural progression.
p239-wav/p239_233.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p239-wav/p239_234.wav|We will turn the corner.
p239-wav/p239_235.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p239-wav/p239_236.wav|My Dad is a hero.
p239-wav/p239_237.wav|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
p239-wav/p239_238.wav|Further details are expected later.
p239-wav/p239_239.wav|This is absolutely not true.
p239-wav/p239_240.wav|They should stop the bombing.
p239-wav/p239_241.wav|These days are long gone.
p239-wav/p239_242.wav|And they were being paid?
p239-wav/p239_243.wav|was everything done to save people?
p239-wav/p239_244.wav|What was the matter for concern?
p239-wav/p239_245.wav|Do I think about them often?
p239-wav/p239_246.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p239-wav/p239_247.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.
p239-wav/p239_248.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p239-wav/p239_249.wav|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239-wav/p239_250.wav|I've come here for the jersey.
p239-wav/p239_251.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p239-wav/p239_252.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p239-wav/p239_253.wav|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239-wav/p239_254.wav|She replied, It could be.
p239-wav/p239_255.wav|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p239-wav/p239_256.wav|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p239-wav/p239_257.wav|We have a budget in March.
p239-wav/p239_258.wav|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p239-wav/p239_259.wav|We have expanded too quickly.
p239-wav/p239_260.wav|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239-wav/p239_261.wav|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239-wav/p239_262.wav|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239-wav/p239_263.wav|Our position remains the same.
p239-wav/p239_264.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p239-wav/p239_265.wav|They could not match it.
p239-wav/p239_266.wav|He is not a pathetic figure.
p239-wav/p239_267.wav|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p239-wav/p239_268.wav|They made such decisions in London.
p239-wav/p239_269.wav|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p239-wav/p239_270.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239-wav/p239_271.wav|Each case is treated on merit.
p239-wav/p239_272.wav|A winter of discontent awaits.
p239-wav/p239_273.wav|I thought we were fantastic.
p239-wav/p239_274.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p239-wav/p239_275.wav|It's going to be very closely watched.
p239-wav/p239_276.wav|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239-wav/p239_277.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.
p239-wav/p239_278.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p239-wav/p239_279.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.
p239-wav/p239_280.wav|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p239-wav/p239_281.wav|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p239-wav/p239_282.wav|There is no internal damage.
p239-wav/p239_283.wav|We've had great things in the past.
p239-wav/p239_284.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p239-wav/p239_285.wav|It has been recorded twice.
p239-wav/p239_286.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p239-wav/p239_287.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p239-wav/p239_288.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p239-wav/p239_289.wav|This youngster is so exciting!
p239-wav/p239_290.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p239-wav/p239_291.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p239-wav/p239_292.wav|They will probably come back.
p239-wav/p239_293.wav|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239-wav/p239_294.wav|I saw them last week.
p239-wav/p239_295.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p239-wav/p239_296.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p239-wav/p239_297.wav|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p239-wav/p239_298.wav|We may need to take some very radical measures.
p239-wav/p239_299.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.
p239-wav/p239_300.wav|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p239-wav/p239_301.wav|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239-wav/p239_302.wav|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239-wav/p239_303.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p239-wav/p239_304.wav|That should give me a chance.
p239-wav/p239_305.wav|They have played their part.
p239-wav/p239_306.wav|This will be our new beginning.
p239-wav/p239_307.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.
p239-wav/p239_308.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p239-wav/p239_309.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p239-wav/p239_310.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.
p239-wav/p239_311.wav|Celtic were the losers then.
p239-wav/p239_312.wav|What do we want to do that for?
p239-wav/p239_313.wav|Does the name matter?
p239-wav/p239_314.wav|how do you get it back?
p239-wav/p239_315.wav|What are you not good at?
p239-wav/p239_316.wav|I think, therefore I am?
p239-wav/p239_317.wav|Who was she?
p239-wav/p239_318.wav|The result is utterly compelling.
p239-wav/p239_319.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p239-wav/p239_320.wav|I have been very nervous.
p239-wav/p239_321.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p239-wav/p239_322.wav|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239-wav/p239_323.wav|I won't make an official complaint.
p239-wav/p239_324.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p239-wav/p239_325.wav|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p239-wav/p239_326.wav|They are looking at a flotation.
p239-wav/p239_327.wav|They make a selective perception process.
p239-wav/p239_328.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p239-wav/p239_329.wav|He was admitted to hospital.
p239-wav/p239_330.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p239-wav/p239_331.wav|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p239-wav/p239_332.wav|January is a bad time of year.
p239-wav/p239_333.wav|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p239-wav/p239_334.wav|Royal Bank declined to comment.
p239-wav/p239_335.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.
p239-wav/p239_336.wav|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p239-wav/p239_337.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.
p239-wav/p239_338.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p239-wav/p239_339.wav|My daughter is an adult.
p239-wav/p239_340.wav|It will affect their work.
p239-wav/p239_341.wav|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p239-wav/p239_342.wav|I am considered a teenager.
p239-wav/p239_343.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p239-wav/p239_344.wav|The FBI could become involved.
p239-wav/p239_345.wav|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p239-wav/p239_346.wav|I just felt that I was broken down.
p239-wav/p239_347.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p239-wav/p239_348.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p239-wav/p239_349.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p239-wav/p239_350.wav|Translation - we got it wrong.
p239-wav/p239_351.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p239-wav/p239_352.wav|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p239-wav/p239_353.wav|What happened in that game?
p239-wav/p239_354.wav|Are you going to win?
p239-wav/p239_355.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p239-wav/p239_356.wav|So, did she meet him?
p239-wav/p239_357.wav|So what is the campaign about?
p239-wav/p239_358.wav|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p239-wav/p239_359.wav|William Hague delighted his party.
p239-wav/p239_360.wav|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p239-wav/p239_361.wav|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p239-wav/p239_362.wav|Walker plans to return indoors.
p239-wav/p239_363.wav|The actual increases will be announced next month.
p239-wav/p239_364.wav|The statement contained no surprises.
p239-wav/p239_365.wav|The scientific debate is dead.
p239-wav/p239_366.wav|This would include the GM food industry.
p239-wav/p239_367.wav|But the rally was short-lived.
p239-wav/p239_368.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p239-wav/p239_369.wav|They are the innocent victims.
p239-wav/p239_370.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p239-wav/p239_371.wav|He ended up a headmaster.
p239-wav/p239_372.wav|That took about two years.
p239-wav/p239_373.wav|He is obviously very dangerous.
p239-wav/p239_374.wav|That remains the unanswered question.
p239-wav/p239_375.wav|This should come as no surprise.
p239-wav/p239_376.wav|It was launched in February last year.
p239-wav/p239_377.wav|Commitment is released on Liberty.
p239-wav/p239_378.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p239-wav/p239_379.wav|He did not say that.
p239-wav/p239_380.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p239-wav/p239_381.wav|We have not been approached.
p239-wav/p239_382.wav|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
p239-wav/p239_383.wav|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p239-wav/p239_384.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p239-wav/p239_385.wav|Those overseas offices were great.
p239-wav/p239_386.wav|Well, that's just a third district.
p239-wav/p239_387.wav|She asked for the appointment with me.
p239-wav/p239_388.wav|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p239-wav/p239_389.wav|A new school will be built.
p239-wav/p239_390.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p239-wav/p239_391.wav|How are you, sir?
p239-wav/p239_392.wav|So is that it, then?
p239-wav/p239_393.wav|Do I have a favourite?
p239-wav/p239_394.wav|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p239-wav/p239_395.wav|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p239-wav/p239_396.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.
p239-wav/p239_397.wav|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
p239-wav/p239_398.wav|We were beaten by the better team.
p239-wav/p239_399.wav|Both sides have to step back.
p239-wav/p239_400.wav|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
p239-wav/p239_401.wav|Everything has its place and purpose.
p239-wav/p239_402.wav|I have received no explanation.
p239-wav/p239_403.wav|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
p239-wav/p239_404.wav|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p239-wav/p239_405.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p239-wav/p239_406.wav|This game is very evenly balanced.
p239-wav/p239_407.wav|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p239-wav/p239_408.wav|It seems a waste of talents.
p239-wav/p239_409.wav|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p239-wav/p239_410.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p239-wav/p239_411.wav|You can feel at home in China.
p239-wav/p239_412.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p239-wav/p239_413.wav|We have no information on Iraq.
p239-wav/p239_414.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p239-wav/p239_415.wav|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p239-wav/p239_416.wav|You're not getting any goodwill.
p239-wav/p239_417.wav|The baby deserves the credit.
p239-wav/p239_418.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p239-wav/p239_419.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p239-wav/p239_420.wav|I should think so, too.
p239-wav/p239_421.wav|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p239-wav/p239_422.wav|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p239-wav/p239_423.wav|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p239-wav/p239_424.wav|The capital costs are modest.
p239-wav/p239_425.wav|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p239-wav/p239_426.wav|It certainly feels that way.
p239-wav/p239_427.wav|This idea has been around for four years.
p239-wav/p239_428.wav|Or maybe it's the other way around.
p239-wav/p239_429.wav|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p239-wav/p239_430.wav|We accept the new rules.
p239-wav/p239_431.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p239-wav/p239_432.wav|They are interior designers and architects.
p239-wav/p239_433.wav|He was released after treatment.
p239-wav/p239_434.wav|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
p239-wav/p239_435.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p239-wav/p239_436.wav|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p239-wav/p239_437.wav|Things are going to change over the next six months.
p239-wav/p239_438.wav|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p239-wav/p239_439.wav|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
p239-wav/p239_440.wav|It is also very valuable.
p239-wav/p239_441.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.
p239-wav/p239_442.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p239-wav/p239_443.wav|They should not feel under threat.
p239-wav/p239_444.wav|Any error is severely punished.
p239-wav/p239_445.wav|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p239-wav/p239_446.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p239-wav/p239_447.wav|Hard cash is needed now.
p239-wav/p239_448.wav|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
p239-wav/p239_449.wav|Blair also had a penalty.
p239-wav/p239_450.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p239-wav/p239_451.wav|Either way, it's very funny.
p239-wav/p239_452.wav|We didn't want any trouble.
p239-wav/p239_453.wav|It seemed a logical expansion.
p239-wav/p239_454.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p239-wav/p239_455.wav|And Michael was just great.
p239-wav/p239_456.wav|Now it has doubled in size.
p239-wav/p239_457.wav|It was never a free kick.
p239-wav/p239_458.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p239-wav/p239_459.wav|This is a great opportunity for us.
p239-wav/p239_460.wav|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
p239-wav/p239_461.wav|Inventories are coming under control.
p239-wav/p239_462.wav|She failed in her action.
p239-wav/p239_463.wav|We will provide immediate access.
p239-wav/p239_464.wav|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
p239-wav/p239_465.wav|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p239-wav/p239_466.wav|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p239-wav/p239_467.wav|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
p239-wav/p239_468.wav|The money is within the total allocation.
p239-wav/p239_469.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p239-wav/p239_470.wav|This does not create any precedent.
p239-wav/p239_471.wav|There's nothing I can say.
p239-wav/p239_472.wav|We need a visionary producer.
p239-wav/p239_473.wav|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p239-wav/p239_474.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p239-wav/p239_475.wav|I am sorry, but I forgot.
p239-wav/p239_476.wav|Banking stocks were hit hard.
p239-wav/p239_477.wav|We did something about it.
p239-wav/p239_478.wav|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p239-wav/p239_479.wav|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p239-wav/p239_480.wav|Five years later, the deception continued.
p239-wav/p239_481.wav|The rescue package is public money.
p239-wav/p239_482.wav|The death toll included five children.
p239-wav/p239_483.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p239-wav/p239_484.wav|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
p239-wav/p239_485.wav|I was there five months ago.
p239-wav/p239_486.wav|It happened again, and again, and again.
p239-wav/p239_487.wav|It could well be military.
p239-wav/p239_488.wav|Holland won by five wickets.
p239-wav/p239_489.wav|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
p239-wav/p239_490.wav|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
p239-wav/p239_491.wav|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p239-wav/p239_492.wav|MOVIE stars are public property.
p239-wav/p239_493.wav|I first met him last summer.
p239-wav/p239_494.wav|The songs are just so good.
p239-wav/p239_495.wav|The whole thing was just unreal.
p239-wav/p239_496.wav|I can hardly believe it.
p239-wav/p239_497.wav|They haven't been thought through.
p239-wav/p239_498.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p239-wav/p239_499.wav|I am not unduly surprised.
p239-wav/p239_500.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p239-wav/p239_501.wav|You are a different people.
p239-wav/p239_502.wav|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p239-wav/p239_503.wav|The world record is suspicious.
